\title{Initiate a spata-object from MALDI Imaging}
\usage{
test()
}
\arguments{
\item{coordinates}{Data.frame containing "unique identifier" meaning a unique description of 
each pixel/spot as well as  x and y coordinates of the position of the spot}

\item{intensity_matrix}{Matrix of intensities with rownames for Proteins/Metabolites/Lipids, and "unique identifier" 
as colnames}

\item{gene_set_path}{Character value (or NULL). Specifies the path to a
.RDS-file containing a data.frame that is to be used as input for slot @used_genesets.

 Must have the character-variables

   \itemize{
    \item{\emph{'ont'}: The gene set names.}
    \item{\emph{'gene'}: The belonging gene names.}
    }

If set to NULL the default gene-set data.frame will used. Run \code{?gsdf} to get more information.}

\item{sample_names}{Character vector. The sample name with which to refer to the
respective sample. Should start with a letter.}

\item{file_name}{Character value. The name-suffix for the file name under which the
spata-object is stored. Is prefixed with \emph{'spata-obj-'} and suffixed with \emph{'.RDS'}.}
}
\value{
A spata-object.
}
\description{
Creates, saves and returns an object of class spata
from scratch. Several samples can be stored in one object, though we recommand to stick
to one. (See details for more.)
}
\details{
The loading and preprocessing of the spata-object  currently relies on the Seurat-package. Before any pre processing function is applied
mitochondrial and stress genes are discarded. For more advanced users the arguments above starting with a capital letter allow to
manipulate the way the spata-object is processed. For all of these arguments apply the following instructions:

\itemize{
  \item{If set to FALSE the processing function is skipped.}
  \item{If set to TRUE the respective function is called with it's default argument settings. Note: \code{RunUMAP()} needs
  additional input!}
  \item{If a named list is provided the respective function is called whereby the named list will provide the argument-input (the seurat-object to be constructed must not be named and will be
  passed to every function as the first argument!!!.)}
  }

Note that certain listed functions require previous functions! E.g. if \code{RunPCA} is set to FALSE \code{RunTSNE()}
will result in an error. (\code{base::tryCatch()} will prevent the function from crashing but the respective slot
is going to be empty.) Skipping functions might result in an incomplete spata-object. Use \code{validateSpataObject()} after
initiating it in order to see which slots are valid and which are not.

Handling more than one sample:

Several samples can be stored in one object. If so, the count-matrices will be combined to one matrix which is given to the seurat-object that is temporarily
initiated in order to perform the pre processing steps. Sample related unambiguity with respect to the barcode's belonging is maintained
by suffixing the barcode-sequences with the respective sample name specified in \code{sample_names}. The meta.data data.frame of the
seurat-object is joined with a variable called \emph{sample} denoting the sample-belonging of every barcode which can be used as input
for pre processing functions.

For now we recommend to stick to one sample per spata-object.
